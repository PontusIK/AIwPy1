## How to play

This is a simple game of **Blackjack**.

You start with **10 poker chips** worth **1000 points total**.<br/>
Each round, you and the dealer both bet **1 chip**.<br/>
The **winner** of the round takes both chips.<br/>
You can keep playing for a high score, or until you **run out of chips**.

### Rules of Blackjack

* The goal is to get as close to **21** as possible without exceeding it.
* Number cards count as their face value.
* Face cards count as **10**.
* Aces count as either **1** or **11**, whichever benefits your hand more.
* If your total exceeds **21**, you bust and immediately lose the round.
* After you stand, the dealer draws cards until reaching at least 17.
* Whoever has the higher total without busting wins the round.
* If both have the same total, the dealer wins the round.
